     Based on the future of the global energy industry continued to erupt demand for carbon fiber, as well as the rapid expansion of production capacity of carbon fiber, carbon fiber is bound to promote the global rapid decline in prices, and to promote rapid volume downstream demand. The Chinese carbon fiber industry in the next period of time, will in the sudden emergence of low-end products, the use of cost advantages rise quickly pushed the domestic demand and the global mainstream low-end market occupied. Our carbon fiber industry to give "good" rating.

Carbon fiber: the most important advanced composite materials reinforced materials

Carbon fiber is the use of a variety of organic fiber in an inert gas, at high temperature to carbonize the carbon content obtained by a method more than 90% of the fibrous carbon material. Carbon fiber is a fiber high performance fiber has the highest strength and modulus of the highest ratio (10 times higher strength than the steel material, the only quality aluminum 1/2), in addition to having excellent mechanical properties, but also combines low density , high temperature, corrosion, abrasion, anti-fatigue, high vibration damping, high electrical and thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, light penetrating strong, electromagnetic shielding type good, and many other fine performance, and thus become an advanced carbon fiber composites The most important enhancement material, is a strategic raw material in the defense industry and the national economy have a pivotal position.

Carbon fiber industry is the former silk (PAN) prepreg production to a specific terminal manufacturers and then such a chain. Polyacrylonitrile fiber when producing PAN-based carbon fiber time, known as the "mother" of the first through polymerization and spinning process of polyacrylonitrile formed. Then, these precursor oxide into an oven at 200 to 300 degrees Celsius oxidized. Also, in the carbonizing furnace at a temperature of between 1000-2000 ° C for carbonization made of carbon fiber.

Applications further expand carbon fiber demand Outbreak

Since the 1970s, carbon fiber used in the aerospace field, increasing its potential applications by the national attention. With the maturity of the carbon fiber precursor technology of dry jet wet spinning and the new technology of radio frequency is gradually replacing the traditional dry and wet spinning, improving the quality of the carbon fiber is climbing, the price dropped significantly, greatly expanded high-performance carbon fiber applications. In the carbon fiber to enhance the quality and prices of the two-driven applications in the field of energy industry will be further intensified.

Energy and industrial achievements in the field of carbon fiber demand rapid outbreak

In 2010 the total amount of carbon fiber demand for energy and industrial applications has accounted for more than 50% PAN-CF total demand, we expect 2019 demand for energy and industrial sectors is expected to increase to 75%, and long-term demand for carbon fiber to promote rapid forward. According to our estimates, due to the demand for wind turbine blades, pressure vessels, automotive and other industries the rapid release of energy and the carbon fiber demand in the industrial sector grew from 29,600 tons in 2011 to 2019 was 105,000 tons, CAGR up to 17%.

(1) CFRP rapid penetration in the field of wind turbine blades, as the largest carbon fiber demand side. Wind energy is a long-term use of renewable natural resources. Currently, wind power technology is mature, a key component of the wind power plant: leaves, is more use of glass fiber reinforced materials (GFRP) manufactured, but GFRP blade size is difficult to meet the requirement to increase the rigidity. Carbon fiber reinforced material (CFRP) application on the blade will undoubtedly promote the development of wind power industry. Wind turbines more than 3MW, the blade length of more than 40m, when using CFRP blade manufacturing has become an inevitable choice. In large size blade production, due to decreased material consumption, transportation and installation costs, etc., but the cost is lower than the CFRP GFRP blade blades. In addition, the use of conductive properties of carbon fiber by special design, can effectively prevent damage caused by lightning strikes to the blades. Currently, the modulus and strength of GFRP blade, the critical length is about 60m, and the specific strength CFRP GFRP is 2 times, the specific modulus is about 3 times the GFRP, CFRP using the critical blade can effectively increase the length . CFRP leaves large capacity fan has become the dominant trend, which points in Europe and Asia is very obvious.

Wind turbine blades has been a major market PAN-CF, and since 2010, the global wind power industry development slows significantly, while China's wind power industry has lost support and state subsidies, in a highly competitive environment, wind power companies will consider more operating costs and risks, not only to consider the cost per kilowatt, but also to pay attention to electricity costs, maintenance costs and electricity generation from wind power and other factors considered investment, wind farm operators in the long run, will benefit large leaves and carbon fibrosis . With 2011 global wind power capacity growth has declined, but is expected in 2019 the world will produce 27,000 and 82,000 wind turbines blades, wherein the carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) will account for about 7% of the total leaf blade material, which needs of close to 64,000 tons /a.2010,2019年风电所需碳纤维量分别为 9990 tons, 64,190 tons, the annual compound growth rate of 23%.

(2) carbon fiber composites in CNG storage growth momentum is great. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is an ideal source of energy, with a low cost, high efficiency, no pollution, use of safety features, power and life as a car fuel sources are decades old. CNG cylinders as storage container is a key component CNG-powered. Because of the gradual promotion of CNG vehicles, CNG cylinders will have a very bright future.

Pressure vessel is CFRP have greater growth potential end markets, particularly in the automotive CNG bottle (CNG), demand in 2010 is 1480t, according to our estimates in 2019 is expected to increase 11470t, will grow 8 times, accounting 10% of the total amount of carbon fiber, the annual compound growth rate of 27.4%.

(3) the growth of carbon fiber composites in the automotive sector can not be ignored. Currently, the automobile industry is facing serious challenges of resources and the environment, and promote car lighter to reduce fuel consumption, it is the theme of the development of the automotive industry. With the processing of composite materials because of low energy consumption, light weight, high strength, can design and strong, corrosion-resistant, and good molding process, the auto industry to become an ideal material for plastic and steel. According to statistics, automotive composites account for more than 23% of the global total of composite materials, and showed a gradual upward trend.

Meanwhile, the carbon fiber composite material in electric vehicles greater use of space. To BMW as an example, the production of i3 is the first major carbon fiber material production cars. Application of new carbon fiber composite materials technology makes the body mass BMWi3 than traditional electric cars to reduce the 250-350kg.

Automotive carbon fiber composite material will be the most potential, one of the huge market demand, particularly in the field of lightweight electric vehicles, driven by demand, in 2010 the demand for carbon fibers for the automotive industry 2300t, according to our estimates is expected to increase to 2019 9300t, the annual compound growth rate of 17%.

(4) other energy and industrial sectors will be different degrees of incremental demand. In other areas of energy and industry, electricity production and transmission, oil exploration, for example, carbon fiber composite materials have maintained varying degrees of incremental demand.

The key to nuclear power is a clean energy supply of nuclear fuel, a nuclear fuel production plant in general by the same dedicated separator composed of hundreds of thousands, if we can increase the production capacity of each separator, the entire plant's production capacity will be greatly increase. All-carbon fiber composite structures splitter, production efficiency is eight times more than the first generation of separator.

Carbon fiber use in the field of power transmission, mainly used to produce a carbon fiber composite core aluminum conductors (ACCC). China's new transmission lines each year one million km, the aging of upgrading railway line approximately 200,000 km, and this figure at a rate of about 50% per year increase, which offer the potential market demand for the ACCC's promoting.
Carbon fiber composite materials have high modulus, strength (7-9 times that of steel), corrosion resistance, easy to repair, impact resistance, thermal expansion coefficient and low thermal conductivity, nor the quality of light buoyancy and many other advantages, is structural parts are widely used in deep-sea oil platforms, such as umbilical reinforcement rods, anchor cables, oil production risers, flexible risers and so on. Mooring carbon fiber composite material can be used to support deep mining depth of 3000m platforms, and excellent corrosion resistance, noodles work up to 25 years.
We predict nuclear power, electric power transmission, oil exploration and other fields, the annual expansion of demand remained at a compound annual growth rate of about 9%, it is another important area of great energy and industrial sectors.
Aerospace demand for carbon fiber is still sustainable outbreak
With the strong support B787, A-380, A-350 and COMACC919 other large projects, the demand for carbon fiber in aerospace will still continue outbreak. The upper limit of the use of CFRP aircraft structural material is about 50% -55%, in addition to B-787 and A-380, the current being developed regional aircraft (less than 200 narrow-body commercial aircraft) there are two kinds, one Shanghai The COMACC919, another Moscow Sukhoi Civil Aircraft 100, they are expected to use 15-37 percent of eligible materials. In 2011--2020 years, 10 years, general aviation is expected to increase 12 400 aircraft and business jets market will add 13,600. In line with the new aircraft materials account for about 54 percent, accounting for about 68% of business jet.
We expect that, with the strong support B787, A-380, A-350 and COMACC919 and other large projects, the demand for carbon fiber in aerospace will also rise sharply. 2011 global aerospace demand for carbon fiber is about 7010 tons, and 2019 we expect to reach 18,100 tons, the annual compound growth rate of 13%.
Demand for consumer and entertainment carbon fibers remained stable
Consumption and entertainment areas, the first application of PAN-CF is a fishing rod, now the world's annual production of carbon fiber fishing rod is about 12 million, each Wangen fishing rods consumes about a tonne of carbon fiber, the global current annual fishing rods carbon fiber with about 1200 tons; annual production of about global carbon fiber golf club about 40 million, each square root of the golf club consumes about 0.5 tons of carbon fiber, the total amount equivalent to 2,000 tons of carbon fiber; last year the world's production of carbon fiber rackets about 4.5 million, to be carbon fiber with about 500 tons; in other areas, carbon fiber is also widely used skis, baseball bat, road race and the ship class sports.
Investment Advice
Based on the rapid expansion of the future of the global energy industry continued outbreak of carbon fiber demand and global (especially in Asia) carbon fiber production capacity, is bound to promote the global carbon fiber rapid decline in prices, and to promote rapid volume downstream demand. The Chinese carbon fiber industry in the next period of time, will in the sudden emergence of low-end products, the use of cost advantages rise quickly pushed the domestic demand and the global mainstream low-end market occupied. Our carbon fiber industry to give "good" rating.
