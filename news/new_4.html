                    <h2>Suggestions on China's exports of graphite electrodes</h2>
                    <i>Update time：<span>2018-2-12</span></i>
                </div>
                <p>Comprehensive analysis, China's exports of graphite electrodes have been significant achievements, but it is undeniable there are also many problems. To this end, I propose the following suggestions and think.


                    First, according to market development and changes in the form and on the demand side, reduce sales cycles, shorten the sales channels, to establish its own sales force as well as the relationship between the upstream and downstream industry chain, the implementation of direct marketing. Carefully study the life cycle of a graphite electrode, a comprehensive analysis of the external environment in which the correct assessment of their competitive strength, to develop and practice the right business strategy. To completely change the "emphasis on production research and development", "the practical research, light-based research," the work of thinking, continue to increase R & D and innovation, should not only increase the existing product R & D investment, to enhance the yield, and more To strengthen the new product R & D investment and management efforts.


                    Second, the RMB exchange rate issue is the economy, has its inherent economic laws. At present China's financial markets and increasingly sophisticated financial products increasingly rich, can borrow dollars through credit markets, to be formed after the return of dollar export revenues, foreign exchange markets may also be used to hedge or direct lock forward settlement rate to hedge the exchange rate risk. It is worth mentioning that the RMB settlement of cross-border trade within the geographical scope has been expanded to the whole country, the more the graphite electrode industry to create a good opportunity. In addition, China's free trade zones, export processing zones or customs surveillance zone policies and processing policies not only can be used to ease the appreciation of the RMB exchange rate decline in export competitiveness, but also reduce tax expenditures, enterprises should pay more attention and legitimate uses.


                    Third, China's export order graphite electrode confusion, not only seriously interfere with and impact on the normal export market, more importantly, will damage our reputation and long-term interests of graphite electrodes in the international market. Must learn a lesson, make great efforts to rectify this, we should actively promote integrity management, actively regulate the order of competition in the industry to accelerate the elimination of backward equipment and production capacity, counterfeit and shoddy wrongdoing, relevant enterprises to actively prepare " fake ", to find ways to actively cooperate with and mobilize customs, commodity inspection, and industrial and commercial departments of enthusiasm, work harder.


                    Fourth, experienced sales service and operational staff, middle managers and visionary endeavor of corporate executives, it is the first resource of graphite electrodes export enterprises can invincible. In order to achieve the export of graphite electrodes business development strategy and objectives, improving export performance, we must pay attention to human resources planning and human resources development, to make career management employees.
